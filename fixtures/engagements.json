All other domains or explicitly listed services are therefore not eligible for reward and do not fall under the Legal Safe Harbor Agreement.\n\nBy participating in this engagement, security researchers undertake to document information about any vulnerability found exclusively via the platform's designated reporting form and not in any other places. They also agree to keep the found vulnerability secret after reporting it on the platform. Finally, they undertake to upload to the platform any data from customers that they have obtained as part of the test and to delete any local copies afterwards and not to distribute them further.\n\n### Hacking Methods\n\nIn participating in the engagement, security researchers agree not to use methods that would adversely affect the tested applications or their users. These include:\n\n- Social engineering\n- Spamming\n- Phishing\n- Denial-of-service attacks or other brute force attacks\n- Physical attacks\n\nIn addition to the prohibited hacking methods listed above, security researchers are required to immediately discontinue vulnerability scanning if they determine that their conduct will result in a significant degradation (negative impact on regular users or on the operations team) of the Platform's or Service's operations.\n\n### Qualified vulnerabilities\n\nAny design or implementation problem can be reported that is reproducible and affects security.\n\nTypical examples:\n\n- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n- Cross Site Scripting (XSS)\n- Insecure Direct Object Reference\n- Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n- Injection Flaws\n- Information Leakage an Improper Error Handling\n- Unauthorized access to properties or accounts\n\nOther examples:\n\n- Data/information leaks\n- Possibility of data/information exfiltration\n- Backdoors that can be actively exploited\n- Potential for unauthorized system use\n- Misconfigurations\n\n### Non-qualified vulnerabilities\n\nThe following vulnerabilities and forms of documentation are generally not wanted and will be rejected:\n\n- Attacks that require physical access to a user's device or network\n- Forms with missing CSRF tokens (unless the criticality exceeds CVSS level 5)\n- Self-XSS\n- The use of a library known to be vulnerable or publicly known to be broken (unless there is active evidence of exploitability)\n- Reports from automated tools or scans without explanatory documentation\n- Social engineering targeting individuals or entities of the organization\n- Denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks\n- Bots, spam, bulk registration\n- Reports of best practices that do not directly result in an exploitable vulnerability (e.g., certificate pinning, missing security headers)\n- Use of vulnerable and \"weak\" cipher suites/ciphers\n- Missing Rate limiting without further security impact\n\n### Legal Safe Harbor\n\nThe organization gives their approval for security researchers to use hacking methods based on the specified briefing. \nDue to this consent, the criminal liability criterion of unauthorized obtaining/unauthorized use and thus the criminal liability of the security researchers with regard to the criminal offenses in Art. \n143 Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised obtaining of data) and Art. 143bis Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised access to a data processing system) does not apply.",

These include:\n\n- Social engineering\n- Spamming\n- Phishing\n- Denial-of-service attacks or other brute force attacks\n- Physical attacks\n\nIn addition to the prohibited hacking methods listed above, security researchers are required to immediately discontinue vulnerability scanning if they determine that their conduct will result in a significant degradation (negative impact on regular users or on the operations team) of the Platform's or Service's operations.\n\n### Qualified vulnerabilities\n\nAny design or implementation problem can be reported that is reproducible and affects security.\n\nTypical examples:\n\n- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n- Cross Site Scripting (XSS)\n- Insecure Direct Object Reference\n- Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n- Injection Flaws\n- Information Leakage an Improper Error Handling\n- Unauthorized access to properties or accounts\n\nOther examples:\n\n- Data/information leaks\n- Possibility of data/information exfiltration\n- Backdoors that can be actively exploited\n- Potential for unauthorized system use\n- Misconfigurations\n\n### Non-qualified vulnerabilities\n\nThe following vulnerabilities and forms of documentation are generally not wanted and will be rejected:\n\n- Attacks that require physical access to a user's device or network\n- Forms with missing CSRF tokens (unless the criticality exceeds CVSS level 5)\n- Self-XSS\n- The use of a library known to be vulnerable or publicly known to be broken (unless there is active evidence of exploitability)\n- Reports from automated tools or scans without explanatory documentation\n- Social engineering targeting individuals or entities of the organization\n- Denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks\n- Bots, spam, bulk registration\n- Reports of best practices that do not directly result in an exploitable vulnerability (e.g., certificate pinning, missing security headers)\n- Use of vulnerable and \"weak\" cipher suites/ciphers\n- Missing Rate limiting without further security impact\n\n### Legal Safe Harbor\n\nThe organization gives their approval for security researchers to use hacking methods based on the specified briefing. \nDue to this consent, the criminal liability criterion of unauthorized obtaining/unauthorized use and thus the criminal liability of the security researchers with regard to the criminal offenses in Art. \n143 Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised obtaining of data) and Art. 143bis Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised access to a data processing system) does not apply.",

All other domains or explicitly listed services are therefore not eligible for reward and do not fall under the Legal Safe Harbor Agreement.\n\nBy participating in this engagement, security researchers undertake to document information about any vulnerability found exclusively via the platform's designated reporting form and not in any other places. They also agree to keep the found vulnerability secret after reporting it on the platform. Finally, they undertake to upload to the platform any data from customers that they have obtained as part of the test and to delete any local copies afterwards and not to distribute them further.\n\n### Hacking Methods\n\nIn participating in the engagement, security researchers agree not to use methods that would adversely affect the tested applications or their users. These include:\n\n- Social engineering\n- Spamming\n- Phishing\n- Denial-of-service attacks or other brute force attacks\n- Physical attacks\n\nIn addition to the prohibited hacking methods listed above, security researchers are required to immediately discontinue vulnerability scanning if they determine that their conduct will result in a significant degradation (negative impact on regular users or on the operations team) of the Platform's or Service's operations.\n\n### Qualified vulnerabilities\n\nAny design or implementation problem can be reported that is reproducible and affects security.\n\nTypical examples:\n\n- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n- Cross Site Scripting (XSS)\n- Insecure Direct Object Reference\n- Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n- Injection Flaws\n- Information Leakage an Improper Error Handling\n- Unauthorized access to properties or accounts\n\nOther examples:\n\n- Data/information leaks\n- Possibility of data/information exfiltration\n- Backdoors that can be actively exploited\n- Potential for unauthorized system use\n- Misconfigurations\n\n### Non-qualified vulnerabilities\n\nThe following vulnerabilities and forms of documentation are generally not wanted and will be rejected:\n\n- Attacks that require physical access to a user's device or network\n- Forms with missing CSRF tokens (unless the criticality exceeds CVSS level 5)\n- Self-XSS\n- The use of a library known to be vulnerable or publicly known to be broken (unless there is active evidence of exploitability)\n- Reports from automated tools or scans without explanatory documentation\n- Social engineering targeting individuals or entities of the organization\n- Denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks\n- Bots, spam, bulk registration\n- Reports of best practices that do not directly result in an exploitable vulnerability (e.g., certificate pinning, missing security headers)\n- Use of vulnerable and \"weak\" cipher suites/ciphers\n- Missing Rate limiting without further security impact\n\n### Legal Safe Harbor\n\nThe organization gives their approval for security researchers to use hacking methods based on the specified briefing. \nDue to this consent, the criminal liability criterion of unauthorized obtaining/unauthorized use and thus the criminal liability of the security researchers with regard to the criminal offenses in Art. \n143 Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised obtaining of data) and Art. 143bis Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised access to a data processing system) does not apply.",

These include:\n\n- Social engineering\n- Spamming\n- Phishing\n- Denial-of-service attacks or other brute force attacks\n- Physical attacks\n\nIn addition to the prohibited hacking methods listed above, security researchers are required to immediately discontinue vulnerability scanning if they determine that their conduct will result in a significant degradation (negative impact on regular users or on the operations team) of the Platform's or Service's operations.\n\n### Qualified vulnerabilities\n\nAny design or implementation problem can be reported that is reproducible and affects security.\n\nTypical examples:\n\n- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n- Cross Site Scripting (XSS)\n- Insecure Direct Object Reference\n- Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n- Injection Flaws\n- Information Leakage an Improper Error Handling\n- Unauthorized access to properties or accounts\n\nOther examples:\n\n- Data/information leaks\n- Possibility of data/information exfiltration\n- Backdoors that can be actively exploited\n- Potential for unauthorized system use\n- Misconfigurations\n\n### Non-qualified vulnerabilities\n\nThe following vulnerabilities and forms of documentation are generally not wanted and will be rejected:\n\n- Attacks that require physical access to a user's device or network\n- Forms with missing CSRF tokens (unless the criticality exceeds CVSS level 5)\n- Self-XSS\n- The use of a library known to be vulnerable or publicly known to be broken (unless there is active evidence of exploitability)\n- Reports from automated tools or scans without explanatory documentation\n- Social engineering targeting individuals or entities of the organization\n- Denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks\n- Bots, spam, bulk registration\n- Reports of best practices that do not directly result in an exploitable vulnerability (e.g., certificate pinning, missing security headers)\n- Use of vulnerable and \"weak\" cipher suites/ciphers\n- Missing Rate limiting without further security impact\n\n### Legal Safe Harbor\n\nThe organization gives their approval for security researchers to use hacking methods based on the specified briefing. \nDue to this consent, the criminal liability criterion of unauthorized obtaining/unauthorized use and thus the criminal liability of the security researchers with regard to the criminal offenses in Art. \n143 Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised obtaining of data) and Art. 143bis Swiss Criminal Code (Unauthorised access to a data processing system) does not apply.",
